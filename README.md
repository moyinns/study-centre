# study-centre
a cute app to use when studying.

I made a study centre program - this have several functions: a todo list to keep tract of tasks + ideas while studying, a pomodoro timer (25min work + 5min rest timer) to aid studying, a stopwatch to keep track of how long certain tasks take, quotes to keep the morale high and a motivational cat to cheer you on! 

I made this project to aid with my revision, and so I had something cute to look at while I revised (for motivation of course!). Moreover, its tailored to meet modern day revision methods (e.g. the pomodoro timer).

I made my project with a mix of Godot and Ibis-Paint X. I designed the background, notebook, colour scheme and icons using Ibis-Paint X. I also selected the fonts I was going to use throughout my project. Then I transferred the images to my laptop and programmed each functon one at a time.

I struggled a lot with the todo-list, I couldn't manage to get the tasks on new lines and there wasn't many tutorials online. At first, it was quite a stressful process, as each time I attempted to fix the error, it would just be replaced with a new one, and it felt like I was making no progress. I decided to leave my project for the day, take a break, and restart later. Coming back at it with a clear mind after coding the other functions allowed me to be able to fix the error, so I would say I learnt it's okay to take breaks, and to start from the basics when stuck. This was also my first project using timers and stopwatches, so I learnt how those work in Godot.
